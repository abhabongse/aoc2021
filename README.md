# Advent of Code 2021

Small code to solve problems at https://adventofcode.com/2021.  
Most of the code are written in Rust.

## How to run solutions

For example, to run the code for **Day 1: Sonar Sweep**:

```bash
$ cargo run --bin day01 inputs/day01.txt
```

You may also add `--release` flag for a more optimized binary:

```bash
$ cargo run --release --bin day01 inputs/day01.txt
```
